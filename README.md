# Salesforce-MeetUp-Challenge
This is a repo containing the Code for the Salesforce Assessment. 
THIS IS FOR THE COODE ASSESSMENT
I haven't used Git hub in years so I apologize for the sloppy organization on the uploads here. 
All of this code works on my instance. I have one validation rule and one field active in my org that will make everything work perfect. 
I am not quite sure how to give you all access to my dev org so you can view it and test it out yourselves. If there are any issues please contact me and I will walk through the code and process with you.
